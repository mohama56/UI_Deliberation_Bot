# Bloomfield Bot Reports

### A UI-Based Reflection on Governance and Accountability for Solana-Based Trading Bots  
**Course:** BANA6020 – Managerial Reporting in Business Analytics  
**Created by:** Alamin Mohammed  
**Instructor:** Professor Robert Bloomfield

## Project Overview

This project presents a web-based interface designed to reflect on the ethical dimensions of an automated Solana trading bot I created earlier in my development work. That bot, focused on identifying potential rug pulls and executing trades with speed, inspired a deeper dive into how automated tools can be governed responsibly.

To explore that, this UI connects bot mechanics with broader questions of accountability and transparency, using the deliberation guide provided in the final weeks of the course as a post-build lens.

## Deliberation Insights Applied After Development

The bot was originally developed to outperform bad actors in the DeFi space. Afterward, I applied the deliberation framework to analyze what ethical responsibilities the bot might hold if it were evaluated as a governed actor.

- **Role Identification** – It performs sniping trades with real-time contract checks to detect scam patterns.
- **Obligations of Speech** – Its alerts about liquidity, minting rights, and token ownership concentration were made visible through the UI.
- **Inside Accountability** – Trade logic was built to reject high-risk setups, not just to maximize speed or profit.
- **Outside Accountability** – The UI now allows users to understand why certain tokens are rejected or flagged.
- **Holding Others Accountable** – By surfacing red flags publicly, this tool challenges low-integrity projects on the network.
